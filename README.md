## Get started

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

I used Expo Go to test the app on my iOS device.

1. Checkout from `master` branch.

2. Install dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the app.

   ```bash
    npx expo start --port 8088 --tunnel
   ```

4. Open the Expo Go app on your iOS device, click on the project named `transaction-history-module`, and you will be seeing the app after few seconds.

5. I have completed all the requirements, but I apologize for not being able to implement the biometric authentication login due to time constraints. üò¢ I used the `react-native-biometrics` library with the intention of authenticating via Face ID. If you'd like to review my progress, the incomplete work is available in the `Feat/biometric-login` branch.
